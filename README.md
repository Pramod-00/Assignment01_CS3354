# Assignment 1: Java program and collaboration (CS3354)

### Objective
- To build a grocery management system using parallel arrays 

## Project Overview.
- Using three parallel arrays to store grocery item information where each index in the array represents same item.
- This assignment is done to practice Java basics like arrays,loops,conditonal statements,methods and github collaborations.
  
### Data structures used
1)Three parallel array's to store item names,item prices, item stock quantities.
here all the array have shared the same index to refer to the same grocerry item.

### What the program Does?
I)View the current grocerry inventory - uses loops to dispaly non empty items.
II)Restock an item by searching for its name - uses loop to search and if item found increases stock quantity, if not prints" item not found"
III)Implements User menu using scanner to take inputs and runs inside a while(true) loop until user chooses to exit the program.

### Collaboration
This assignment was completed as a group project. Each group member worked on their own feature branch, pushed their code to GitHub.
the branches were later merged into the main branch after completion.
